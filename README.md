# Technical
* Project was tested via Expo 2.24.4 on iOS 11.4
* Files located in 'php_files' normally would be located on server, but in my case they were stored in 'htdocs' folder provided by XAMPP.
* 'notes_app.sql' file contains exported database with 'Add the CREATE DATABASE / USE statement' option selected
* 'LOCALHOST.js' located in app directory contains my IP address.
